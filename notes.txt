x skinnier
x swap pos of notes and bzpts
x fix bad buzz point error
x TU data from cols E-G not A-C
x make it cut paste Proof : DG column - #Ref use OFFSET? no. Use INDEX?
x -> aseem suggests making the error obvious

x maybe allow editing on packet number?
x concat list of errors
x maybe sort the 2 bzpts
x move cats and authors in data spreadsheet
x detailed stats: unhide 15 stuff (Teams-cats, Players, pivots)
